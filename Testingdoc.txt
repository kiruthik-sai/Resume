The business is Mar Vista Cheap Mobile Notary, a 7-day-a-week 24-hour by-appointment and mobile-only notary service that services all of the Los Angeles County area. They have a Google my business listing located in Mar Vista and get 90% of their customers through calls to their business listing. They can assist with any kind of document that can be notarized, but do not notarize I9's, immigration services, and do not do apostille or provide marriage licenses. While there is an address on their Google listing, they do not accept walk-ins and are mobile only. The only limitations they have on clientele they can serve, are that the clients must have their documents prepared, or if they want, the company can print the documents for an additional $20 charge, and they must have a valid, unexpired ID, or if it is expired, must be issued within the last 5 years. Scan-backs are also an additional $20 charge. Prices are $15 per notarized signature, plus a travel fee which is highly variable depending on distance and time of day, so the client must speak with the notary to get a quote on the travel fee. This business wants to use the AI to answer basic questions such as what documents can be notarized and what the client would need to bring to an appointment, California rules regarding notary services, and service hours for the business. The business also wants to use the AI as an appointment scheduler and put appointments in the business's calendar. The AI should not handle financial information such as credit card or any other form of payment from a prospect or client.
